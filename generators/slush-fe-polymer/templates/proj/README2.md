# Secure GAE Scaffold with Polymer(UNIT9)

## Polymer
----

Polymer lets you build encapsulated, re-usable elements that work just like 
standard HTML elements, to use in building web applications.

This boilerplate consists structure of files used by framework. Existing files 
should be helpfull in generic situation, however some of them may be changed or 
removed.

Gulp script has been modified to handle framework files and structure. Some 
additional tasks has been created to handle and optimise final build.
