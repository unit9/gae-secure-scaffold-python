# Secure GAE Scaffold with Angular2 (UNIT9)

## Angular2
----

Angular 2 is dramatically faster than Angular 1 with support for fast initial 
loads through server-side pre-rendering, offline compile for fast startup, 
and ultrafast change detection and view caching for smooth virtual scrolling 
and snappy view transitions.

This boilerplate consists structure of files used by framework. Existing files 
should be helpfull in generic situation, however some of them may be changed or 
removed.

Gulp script has been modified to handle framework files and structure. Some 
additional tasks has been created to handle and optimise final build.

## New Component
----

To create new component for angular framework you don't have to create bunch of 
files manually. Use appropriate generator instead:

`$ slush fe-angular2:component [path/to/][component-name]`
